Run the code locally:
Option 1: Use a simple local server (recommended)
Modern browsers may block scripts due to security reasons when you open HTML files directly from the filesystem. Running a local server can avoid such issues.

Using VSCode with Live Server Extension:

Install Visual Studio Code.
Open your project folder in VSCode.
Install the Live Server Extension.
Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server." This will open your game in the browser, and you can see it live.
Using Python's built-in HTTP server:

Open a terminal/command prompt.
Navigate to the project folder (where your index.html is located).

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.



Option 2: Open index.html directly in the browser (for quick testing)
Simply double-click index.html to open it in your browser. This will work, but you may face issues with certain JavaScript features depending on your browser's security settings.
